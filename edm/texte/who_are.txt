textField=Shermag is a leader in the production and distribution of high-quality residential furniture. The Company enjoys an enviable reputation in the North American market and figures prominently in the design of contemporary-style furniture.
Shermag’s facilities include a network of medium-size factories equipped with state-of-the-art technology. Vertical integration - from the forest to the retailer - gives the Company an exceptional competitive edge in a highly fragmented industrial sector. Three hardwood sawmills, a plant specializing in the fabrication of components, and a veneer plant all contribute to the efficiency of the Company’s eleven furniture manufacturing facilities and to a lowering of production costs.
Shermag focuses on specific markets in the sale of its products. Major department stores in the United States and Canada, multiple-location chain stores specializing in the distribution of high-end furniture, as well as the best independent retailers comprise the Company’s marketing targets.
Shermag’s management is also concerned about offering good working conditions to its 2,400 employees.
