    Forums</small></strong></font><p>Installation Steps:</p>
      <p>1 Unzip using Winzip or similar.<br>
      <br>
      2. Copy all the unzipped files to your web server. Please note that some web space providers only
      allow databases and asp files in certain folders. For example,
      ewebcity.com insist that you use the db folder. You must check your
      provider's documentation to ensure that you locate your files in
      appropriate folder. If you try to use the forum and you get an error
      something like &quot;driver operation must use an updateable query&quot;
      this means that you have put the files in a folder that does not allow
      databases.</p>
      <p>3. Edit 'basics.inc' (basic forum features) and db.inc (to specify
      different database location, if required. Edit password.asp in order to
      change the password.</p>
      <p>4. The software should now work. In your browser, open the web-page <a
    href="http://...../forums/list.asp">http://...../.../index.asp</a>.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>5. To delete messages, first login at login.asp</p>
    <p>Please keep the link to Ourline Forums. Let me know where and how you use the software.
    I generally do not offer support. The most common problem however (99% of
    all queries) relates to the updateable query error reported, with solution,
    in step 1.</p>
